 *     values in info are set to defaults (BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL
 *     and BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_WINDOW) the radio module default values
 *     are used. It is assumed that the macro defaults
 *     match the radio defaults (see BT_DEFAULT_PAGE_SCAN_WINDOW
 *     documentation.) So, the first call to ME_SetAccessibleModeNC
 *     with info set to 0 will not change the settings as the radio has
 *     already been initialized to its default settings. If there is
 *     a connection or a connection is in the process  of being created
 *     then mode and info are saved and applied when all connections are 
 *     disconnected.  
 *
 *     To keep other devices from finding and connecting to this 
 *     device set the mode to BAM_NOT_ACCESSIBLE. The default mode when
 *     the stack is first loaded and initialized is controlled by
 *     BT_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MODE_NC.
 *
 *     In setting the values for info. Both "inqWindow" and
 *     "inqInterval" must be set to defaults or to legitimate
 *     values. The range for values is 0x0012 to 0x1000. The time
 *     calculated by taking the value * 0.625ms. It is an error
 *     if one is a default and the other is not. This is also true
 *     for "pageInterval" and "pageWindow".
 *
 *     Any time the scan interval or window is different from 
 *     the current settings in the radio, the radio will be 
 *     instructed to change to the new settings. This means that 
 *     if there are different settings for the connected state
 *     versus the non-connected state, the radio module will be 
 *     instructed to change the settings when the first connection 
 *     comes up and when the last connection goes down
 *     (automatically). This also means that if different values
 *     for window and interval are set when going from any setting
 *     of accessible to non-accessible then the radio will be 
 *     instructed to change. In most cases it is best to use
 *     the radio defaults. In this way the radio is never told
 *     to change the scan interval or window.
 *
 * Parameters:

 *
 *     info - pointer to structure containing the inquiry and page
 *         scan interval and window to use. If info is 0 then the

 *         If the operation is successful the "aMode" field of BtEvent
 *         indicates the new mode.  A BTEVENT_HCI_FATAL_ERROR event

 *
