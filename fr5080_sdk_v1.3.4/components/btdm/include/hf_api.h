 /*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * hf_connect()
 *
 *     This function creates a service level connection with the Audio 
 *     Gateway.  This includes performing SDP Queries to find the 
 *     appropriate service and opening an RFCOMM channel.  The success of 
 *     the operation is indicated by the HF_EVENT_SERVICE_CONNECTED event.  
 *     If the connection fails, the application is notified by the 
 *     HF_EVENT_SERVICE_DISCONNECTED event.  
 * 
 *     If an ACL link does not exist to the audio gateway, one will be 
 *     created first.  If desired, however, the ACL link can be established 
 *     prior to calling this function.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     Chan - Pointer to a registered channel structure.  
 *
 *     Addr - The Bluetooth address of the remote device.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started; the application will 
 *         be notified when the connection has been created (via the 
 *         callback function registered by HF_Register).  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specified channel has not been registered.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_BUSY - The operation failed because a connection is already 
 *         open to the remote device, or a new connection is being created.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - The channel has not been registered.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_CONNECTION_FAILED - The connection failed.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).  
 *      
 *     BT_STATUS_NO_RESOURCES - Not enough channel to create link

 *
 *     When the command issued as a result of this call is completed, 
 *     the HF_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event will be received by the 
 *     application's callback function.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Chan - Pointer to a registered channel structure.  
 *
 *     Gain - The current gain level (0-15).  
 *
 *     Command - A command structure to be used for transmitting the 
 *         command.  Until the Bluetooth stack sends the 
 *         HF_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event for this command back to the 
 *         application, the application must not reuse the memory space in 
 *         this structure, but instead must use different command structure 
 *         instances for sending additional commands.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started, the application will 
 *         be notified when the command has completed (via the callback 
 *         function registered by HF_Register).
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specified channel has not been registered.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NO_CONNECTION - The operation failed because a service link 
 *         does not exist to the audio gateway.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter invalid or not properly 
 *         initialized (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).  
 * 
 *     BT_STATUS_NO_RESOURCES - Not enough memory to create cmd parameter
