/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * a2dp_open_stream()
 *
 *    Searches for and begins to open a stream on the remote device.  This 
 *    function searches for a stream with capabilities matching those that 
 *    were registered using A2DP_Register() and 
 *    A2DP_AddContentProtection().  As streams are discovered, the 
 *    application is notified of matching capability types through the 
 *    A2DP_EVENT_CODEC_INFO and A2DP_EVENT_CP_INFO events.  The application 
 *    can cache or verify the specific elements of these capabilities.  When 
 *    all matching capabilities have been discovered, the application is 
 *    notified through the A2DP_EVENT_GET_CONFIG_IND event.  When this event 
 *    is received, the application must call A2DP_SetStreamConfig().  The 
 *    connection progress will not continue until the stream has been 
 *    configured. Once configured, the application will receive the 
 *    A2DP_STREAM_OPEN event.  When this event has been received with no 
 *    errors, the stream is open.  If no streams with matching capabilities 
 *    can be found, the stream is closed.  
 *
 *    A2DP_AbortStream() can be called to close the stream to abort this 
 *    process if necessary.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     type - The type of endpoint to connect to (Source or Sink).
 *
 *     Addr - The Bluetooth address of the device to which the connection 
 *            should be made.  If Addr is 0, then a device inquiry will be 
 *            initiated.  A Device Monitor handler must be registered to 
 *            receive events and to select the desired device.  It is only 
 *            possible to use and value of 0 for Addr if connecting to a 
 *            device that is not already connected.  If the device was 
 *            already connected, an attempt to connect again will fail.  To 
 *            establish a new stream to an already connected device, the 
 *            BD_ADDR_T of the connected device must be used in the Addr 
 *            parameter.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The Open Stream operation was started 
 *         successfully.  Codec and Content Protection events will be 
 *         received if a stream is discovered.
